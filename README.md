# Learn-By-Example-The-Foundations-of-HTML-CSS-Javascript
This is the code repository for [Software Automation Using Puppet For Beginners [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learn-example-foundations-html-css-javascript-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Closures, prototypes, JSON, the DOM, selectors, inheritance in CSS and in JavaScript, and first class functions - that's what this course is about. This is not a course on JavaScript frameworks - its about solid, fundamental HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You'll be surprised by how much more you can get done on your web pages once you learn these technologies the right way. Basic HTML: Folks stopped counting HTML as a language worth formally learning sometime in the 90s, but this is only partially justified. It always helps to have strong basics. CSS: Cascading Stylesheets are incredibly powerful, and incredibly hard to use - until you know how they really work. Once you understand inheritance and selection in CSS, it will all make a lot more sense. JavaScript is a full-fledged, powerful and complicated language. Its really important to learn JavaScript formally, because it is just so different from most other languages you would have encountered. For instance - JavaScript has objects and inheritance but no classes. Closures in JavaScript are a rather mind-bending concept - functions that "remember" how the world looked when they were created. Prototypes are JavaScript's way of doing inheritance, and its very different from the C++/Java way of doing it. JSON is not conceptually difficult to use, but it is incredibly important, and you should understand why - because its the glue between backends written in Java or other traditional languages, and front-ends written in JavaScript. The Document-Object-Model is what ties JavaScript back to HTML and CSS. Together with JSON, the DOM ties it all together from server to skin.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
<DIV class=book-info-will-learn-text>
<UL>
<LI>Any modern browser and a simple text editor are all that will be needed for the code examples
<LI>Some prior programming experience will definitely help in the advanced Javascript portions - if you are entirely new to programming, the second half of the Javascript section will seem very challenging
